tolerance_odes_heatmap_rev.py
- set up to use numpy arrays for populations and do vector arithmetic instead of using locals()
* see if you can keep x as one whole or just 2

4/18/23
tolerance_odes_heatmap_rev.py
- set up numpy arrays for Es
* work on S now that there isn't a check for nS = 0; prob if

tolerance_odes_heatmap_rev.py
- numpification
* changes to other files: needs to give numpy array M L A Egs Els Sgs Sls, lags needs to have two lists
hcb_sim_heatmap_rev.py
- changed order in output to grow > lag
* change throughout
- remove tot from output
- remove what can be placed in top parameters from output
* watch for extraneous effects

* fix places that use n, 0 format e.g. generate_mutants

4/20/23
hcb_sim_heatmap_rev.py
* need to fix growing lagging
