tolerance_odes_heatmap_rev.py
- set up to use numpy arrays for populations and do vector arithmetic instead of using locals()
* see if you can keep x as one whole or just 2

4/18/23
tolerance_odes_heatmap_rev.py
- set up numpy arrays for Es
* work on S now that there isn't a check for nS = 0; prob if

4/19/23
tolerance_odes_heatmap_rev.py
- numpification
* changes to other files: needs to give numpy array M L A Egs Els Sgs Sls, lags needs to have two lists
hcb_sim_heatmap_rev.py
- changed order in output to grow > lag
* change throughout
- remove tot from output
- remove what can be placed in top parameters from output
* watch for extraneous effects

* fix places that use n, 0 format e.g. generate_mutants

4/20/23
hcb_sim_heatmap_rev.py
* need to fix growing lagging

5/12/23
calc_frac
*fixed order of init_cond to [Egs, Els, Sgs, Sls]

6/11/23
made heatplots w met and lac [0, 1, 5, 10, 15, 20]
*add more data points as there appears to maybe be a lightening trend toward higher values

6/12/23
expanded 6/11/23 heatmap to 0-40 for met & lac; no observable change in trend.
*graph frac rate over lac for co-culture, and then mono-culture

6/13/23
lac paired with met:1 appears to have no effect on co-culture above ~200.
Re-tried mono:80, 2780, 0 and co:1, 2780, 0 to find that difference is now not significant. Init. nutrient has little effect on outcome.

6/15/23
Started E.coli S.enterica frequency graph over cycle.
*Figure out groupby to sns.hisplot pipeline

6/22/23
Stopped pandas from putting a space between lines in hcb_sim
*Observe effect of changing old hcb_sim to postmutate to see if significant distance between co and mono
at 1, 2780 persists.

6/23/23
Previous significants with co: 1 2780 0 and mon: 80 2780 0 are due to lack of mutation, giving mono a terribly small number.
Was fixed by postmutating and bringing mutation rate to 0.001 for speed.
Graphed impact of lactose on survival fraction rate of mono and co.
*mutate at halfway
